Project Name: SHAKTHI
Tagline: Bridging the gap between women's wellness and professional empowerment.

1. The Vision
Shakthi is a holistic digital ecosystem designed to solve the specific, often overlooked challenges women face in their health, safety, and careers. Unlike generic wellness apps, Shakthi uses a Problem-Solution Framework to ensure every feature addresses a real-world barrier to success.

2. Core Pillars & Problem Solving
🩺 Health Hub (The Data Gap): * The Issue: Medical gaslighting and lack of symptom history often lead to misdiagnosis.

The Solution: An encrypted Symptom Sync tool that transforms daily logs into professional medical reports for doctors.

⚖️ Smart Education (The Misinformation Gap):

The Issue: The internet is flooded with unverified health and legal advice.

The Solution: A Verified Content Filter that ensures users only see resources approved by certified legal and medical experts.

💼 Career Growth (The Confidence Gap):

The Issue: Statistics show women negotiate significantly lower starting salaries than men.

The Solution: An AI Negotiation Lab where users can practice high-stakes roleplay in a safe, judgment-free environment.

💰 Financial Tools (The Wealth Gap):

The Issue: Complex financial jargon acts as a barrier to investing.

The Solution: Micro-Goal Portfolios that simplify wealth-building into small, manageable daily actions.

3. Unique Selling Points (USPs)
Privacy-First "Ghost Mode": A unique safety feature that instantly camouflages the app’s UI and browser title (e.g., changing "Shakthi" to "Local Weather") to protect users in sensitive domestic situations.

Stealth SOS: A discreet, quick-access emergency trigger that sends encrypted location data to trusted contacts without alerting anyone nearby.

Inclusive UI/UX: Built with a "Rule of Three" philosophy (any critical tool is reachable in 3 taps) and high-contrast accessibility for all users.

4. Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (via Babel for lightweight deployment)

Styling: CSS3 Custom Variables (using the Amethyst and Coral "Aura" theme)

Logic: JavaScript (ES6+) for encryption simulation and state management.

5. Future Roadmap
AI Legal Bot: Real-time assistance for navigating workplace harassment laws.

Community Mentorship: A peer-to-peer network connecting senior executives with students.

Offline Access: SMS-based SOS functionality for users without active data plans.# Empowering-womens-health-and-wellness
